               <h2>Tokyo</h2>
               <p>
                  The first location of this trip was Tokyo, specifically the Ikebukuro, Shibuya, Ginza, and Akihabara districts. My family and I spent most of our time in the Ginza district since our hotel was located here. We were also visiting during New Years so it was interesting to see Tokyo in christmas lights and posters for New Year festivities. During our time in the Ikebukuro and Shibuya districts, we visited a shrine to start out the New Year as well as some of the malls in the area to buy merchandise that was exclusive to Japan. We also met up with some family who were also visiting Japan at the time in Akihabara. While we were traveling together, we went to multiple anime stores and tried out different Japanese street foods.

               <h2>Kyoto</h2>
               <p>
                  The second location of our trip was Kyoto. This was a day trip and was possible thanks to the bullet train. We woke up early so that we could start our day in Kyoto at a reasonable time. Once we arrived, we went straight to Fushimi Inari Shrine to pay our respects and to experience the wonder that was the thousand tori gate walk of the shrine. After our shrine visit, we went to a bamboo walking park and visited the Pokemon Center to look for any exclusive local items. We had dinner at a local restaurant close to the station before heading back to Tokyo to end the night.

               <h2>Osaka</h2>
               <p>
                  The third location we visited on this trip was Osaka. Similar to Kyoto, we took the bullet train to visit Osaka for a day. Our first stop was Osaka Castle. Walking through the castle grounds felt surreal and the architecture looked amazing. After walking around the castle, we went to Kuromon Market to look for local foods. Some foods we tried at the market were black sesame ice cream, takoyaki, and freshly grilled wagyu beef.

               <h2>Favorite Dish</h2>
               <p>
                  My favorite dish from this entire trip was the curry omurice from Hachinoya. The egg and the curry go very well together. It was a very filling and satisfying meal to have.

               <h2>Favorite Location</h2>
               <p>
                  Out of all the places we visited on this trip, my favorite location was the Tokyo Sky Tree. It was really fun exploring the different shops they have inside the Sky Tree. The view on the patio area to look up at the Sky Tree was also nice to walk around with the christmas lights.
